## Events

Event posts work similarly to content posts, but with a few changes.

1.  Events have an event date that needs to be set.

2.  Events show up in order of the event date, with the soonest event being at the top. Events no longer appear after their event date.

3.  Events have optional longitude and latitude coordinates to show a google map below the post in the post page.

4.  A title and date are required in order to submit an event post.
