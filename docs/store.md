## Store

(This doc is a WIP)

Product posts work similarly to content posts as well, but but they also have a price and quantity that need set. As users purchase items, the quantity will decrease.

In addition to products, orders exist. Orders are created when customers checkout with their cart. Orders can be marked as shipped or deleted. Marking as shipped just toggles a boolean value while deleting the order completely removes the record.
