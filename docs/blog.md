## Blog

Blog posts work similarly to content posts, but with a few changes.

1.  A title and content are required in order to submit a blog post.

2.  Blog posts will only show up in the blog section of the website. If you would like for a blog post to also serve as website content, you will need to create a separate content post.

3.  Blog posts show up in order of published date. If you created a blog post a year ago, but only just published it today, it will show up near the top of your blog posts.
